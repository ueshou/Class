   HARVEST IS ENDED AND SUMMER IS GONE     QUOTED ANNE SHIRLEY  GAZING ACROSS THE SHORN FIELDS DREAMILY  SHE AND DIANA BARRY HAD BEEN PICKING APPLES IN THE GREEN GABLES ORCHARD  BUT WERE NOW RESTING FROM THEIR LABORS IN A SUNNY CORNER  WHERE AIRY FLEETS OF THISTLEDOWN DRIFTED BY ON THE WINGS OF A WIND THAT WAS STILL SUMMER SWEET WITH THE INCENSE OF FERNS IN THE HAUNTED WOOD 

BUT EVERYTHING IN THE LANDSCAPE AROUND THEM SPOKE OF AUTUMN  THE SEA WAS ROARING HOLLOWLY IN THE DISTANCE  THE FIELDS WERE BARE AND SERE  SCARFED WITH GOLDEN ROD  THE BROOK VALLEY BELOW GREEN GABLES OVERFLOWED WITH ASTERS OF ETHEREAL PURPLE  AND THE LAKE OF SHINING WATERS WAS BLUE   BLUE   BLUE  NOT THE CHANGEFUL BLUE OF SPRING  NOR THE PALE AZURE OF SUMMER  BUT A CLEAR  STEADFAST  SERENE BLUE  AS IF THE WATER WERE PAST ALL MOODS AND TENSES OF EMOTION AND HAD SETTLED DOWN TO A TRANQUILITY UNBROKEN BY FICKLE DREAMS 

   IT HAS BEEN A NICE SUMMER     SAID DIANA  TWISTING THE NEW RING ON HER LEFT HAND WITH A SMILE     AND MISS LAVENDAR   S WEDDING SEEMED TO COME AS A SORT OF CROWN TO IT  I SUPPOSE MR  AND MRS  IRVING ARE ON THE PACIFIC COAST NOW    

   IT SEEMS TO ME THEY HAVE BEEN GONE LONG ENOUGH TO GO AROUND THE WORLD     SIGHED ANNE 

   I CAN   T BELIEVE IT IS ONLY A WEEK SINCE THEY WERE MARRIED  EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED  MISS LAVENDAR AND MR  AND MRS  ALLAN GONE   HOW LONELY THE MANSE LOOKS WITH THE SHUTTERS ALL CLOSED  I WENT PAST IT LAST NIGHT  AND IT MADE ME FEEL AS IF EVERYBODY IN IT HAD DIED    

   WE   LL NEVER GET ANOTHER MINISTER AS NICE AS MR  ALLAN     SAID DIANA  WITH GLOOMY CONVICTION     I SUPPOSE WE   LL HAVE ALL KINDS OF SUPPLIES THIS WINTER  AND HALF THE SUNDAYS NO PREACHING AT ALL  AND YOU AND GILBERT GONE   IT WILL BE AWFULLY DULL    

   FRED WILL BE HERE     INSINUATED ANNE SLYLY 

   WHEN IS MRS  LYNDE GOING TO MOVE UP     ASKED DIANA  AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD ANNE   S REMARK 

   TOMORROW  I   M GLAD SHE   S COMING   BUT IT WILL BE ANOTHER CHANGE  MARILLA AND I CLEARED EVERYTHING OUT OF THE SPARE ROOM YESTERDAY  DO YOU KNOW  I HATED TO DO IT  OF COURSE  IT WAS SILLY   BUT IT DID SEEM AS IF WE WERE COMMITTING SACRILEGE  THAT OLD SPARE ROOM HAS ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A SHRINE TO ME  WHEN I WAS A CHILD I THOUGHT IT THE MOST WONDERFUL APARTMENT IN THE WORLD  YOU REMEMBER WHAT A CONSUMING DESIRE I HAD TO SLEEP IN A SPARE ROOM BED   BUT NOT THE GREEN GABLES SPARE ROOM  OH  NO  NEVER THERE  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO TERRIBLE   I COULDN   T HAVE SLEPT A WINK FROM AWE  I NEVER WALKED THROUGH THAT ROOM WHEN MARILLA SENT ME IN ON AN ERRAND   NO  INDEED  I TIPTOED THROUGH IT AND HELD MY BREATH  AS IF I WERE IN CHURCH  AND FELT RELIEVED WHEN I GOT OUT OF IT  THE PICTURES OF GEORGE WHITEFIELD AND THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON HUNG THERE  ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE MIRROR  AND FROWNED SO STERNLY AT ME ALL THE TIME I WAS IN  ESPECIALLY IF I DARED PEEP IN THE MIRROR  WHICH WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE HOUSE THAT DIDN   T TWIST MY FACE A LITTLE  I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW MARILLA DARED HOUSECLEAN THAT ROOM  AND NOW IT   S NOT ONLY CLEANED BUT STRIPPED BARE  GEORGE WHITEFIELD AND THE DUKE HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO THE UPSTAIRS HALL     SO PASSES THE GLORY OF THIS WORLD        CONCLUDED ANNE  WITH A LAUGH IN WHICH THERE WAS A LITTLE NOTE OF REGRET  IT IS NEVER PLEASANT TO HAVE OUR OLD SHRINES DESECRATED  EVEN WHEN WE HAVE OUTGROWN THEM 

   I   LL BE SO LONESOME WHEN YOU GO     MOANED DIANA FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME     AND TO THINK YOU GO NEXT WEEK    

   BUT WE   RE TOGETHER STILL     SAID ANNE CHEERILY     WE MUSTN   T LET NEXT WEEK ROB US OF THIS WEEK   S JOY  I HATE THE THOUGHT OF GOING MYSELF   HOME AND I ARE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS  TALK OF BEING LONESOME  IT   S I WHO SHOULD GROAN  YOU   LL BE HERE WITH ANY NUMBER OF YOUR OLD FRIENDS   AND FRED  WHILE I SHALL BE ALONE AMONG STRANGERS  NOT KNOWING A SOUL    

   EXCEPT GILBERT   AND CHARLIE SLOANE     SAID DIANA  IMITATING ANNE   S ITALICS AND SLYNESS 

   CHARLIE SLOANE WILL BE A GREAT COMFORT  OF COURSE     AGREED ANNE SARCASTICALLY  WHEREUPON BOTH THOSE IRRESPONSIBLE DAMSELS LAUGHED  DIANA KNEW EXACTLY WHAT ANNE THOUGHT OF CHARLIE SLOANE  BUT  DESPITE SUNDRY CONFIDENTIAL TALKS  SHE DID NOT KNOW JUST WHAT ANNE THOUGHT OF GILBERT BLYTHE  TO BE SURE  ANNE HERSELF DID NOT KNOW THAT 

   THE BOYS MAY BE BOARDING AT THE OTHER END OF KINGSPORT  FOR ALL I KNOW     ANNE WENT ON     I AM GLAD I   M GOING TO REDMOND  AND I AM SURE I SHALL LIKE IT AFTER A WHILE  BUT FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS I KNOW I WON   T  I SHAN   T EVEN HAVE THE COMFORT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO THE WEEKEND VISIT HOME  AS I HAD WHEN I WENT TO QUEEN   S  CHRISTMAS WILL SEEM LIKE A THOUSAND YEARS AWAY    

   EVERYTHING IS CHANGING   OR GOING TO CHANGE     SAID DIANA SADLY     I HAVE A FEELING THAT THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN  ANNE    

   WE HAVE COME TO A PARTING OF THE WAYS  I SUPPOSE     SAID ANNE THOUGHTFULLY     WE HAD TO COME TO IT  DO YOU THINK  DIANA  THAT BEING GROWN UP IS REALLY AS NICE AS WE USED TO IMAGINE IT WOULD BE WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN    

   I DON   T KNOW   THERE ARE SOME NICE THINGS ABOUT IT     ANSWERED DIANA  AGAIN CARESSING HER RING WITH THAT LITTLE SMILE WHICH ALWAYS HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING ANNE FEEL SUDDENLY LEFT OUT AND INEXPERIENCED     BUT THERE ARE SO MANY PUZZLING THINGS  TOO  SOMETIMES I FEEL AS IF BEING GROWN UP JUST FRIGHTENED ME   AND THEN I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO BE A LITTLE GIRL AGAIN    

   I SUPPOSE WE   LL GET USED TO BEING GROWNUP IN TIME     SAID ANNE CHEERFULLY     THERE WON   T BE SO MANY UNEXPECTED THINGS ABOUT IT BY AND BY   THOUGH  AFTER ALL  I FANCY IT   S THE UNEXPECTED THINGS THAT GIVE SPICE TO LIFE  WE   RE EIGHTEEN  DIANA  IN TWO MORE YEARS WE   LL BE TWENTY  WHEN I WAS TEN I THOUGHT TWENTY WAS A GREEN OLD AGE  IN NO TIME YOU   LL BE A STAID  MIDDLE AGED MATRON  AND I SHALL BE NICE  OLD MAID AUNT ANNE  COMING TO VISIT YOU ON VACATIONS  YOU   LL ALWAYS KEEP A CORNER FOR ME  WON   T YOU  DI DARLING  NOT THE SPARE ROOM  OF COURSE   OLD MAIDS CAN   T ASPIRE TO SPARE ROOMS  AND I SHALL BE AS    UMBLE AS URIAH HEEP  AND QUITE CONTENT WITH A LITTLE OVER THE PORCH OR OFF THE PARLOR CUBBY HOLE    

   WHAT NONSENSE YOU DO TALK  ANNE     LAUGHED DIANA     YOU   LL MARRY SOMEBODY SPLENDID AND HANDSOME AND RICH   AND NO SPARE ROOM IN AVONLEA WILL BE HALF GORGEOUS ENOUGH FOR YOU   AND YOU   LL TURN UP YOUR NOSE AT ALL THE FRIENDS OF YOUR YOUTH    

   THAT WOULD BE A PITY  MY NOSE IS QUITE NICE  BUT I FEAR TURNING IT UP WOULD SPOIL IT     SAID ANNE  PATTING THAT SHAPELY ORGAN     I HAVEN   T SO MANY GOOD FEATURES THAT I COULD AFFORD TO SPOIL THOSE I HAVE  SO  EVEN IF I SHOULD MARRY THE KING OF THE CANNIBAL ISLANDS  I PROMISE YOU I WON   T TURN UP MY NOSE AT YOU  DIANA    

WITH ANOTHER GAY LAUGH THE GIRLS SEPARATED  DIANA TO RETURN TO ORCHARD SLOPE  ANNE TO WALK TO THE POST OFFICE  SHE FOUND A LETTER AWAITING HER THERE  AND WHEN GILBERT BLYTHE OVERTOOK HER ON THE BRIDGE OVER THE LAKE OF SHINING WATERS SHE WAS SPARKLING WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF IT 

   PRISCILLA GRANT IS GOING TO REDMOND  TOO     SHE EXCLAIMED     ISN   T THAT SPLENDID  I HOPED SHE WOULD  BUT SHE DIDN   T THINK HER FATHER WOULD CONSENT  HE HAS  HOWEVER  AND WE   RE TO BOARD TOGETHER  I FEEL THAT I CAN FACE AN ARMY WITH BANNERS   OR ALL THE PROFESSORS OF REDMOND IN ONE FELL PHALANX   WITH A CHUM LIKE PRISCILLA BY MY SIDE    

   I THINK WE   LL LIKE KINGSPORT     SAID GILBERT     IT   S A NICE OLD BURG  THEY TELL ME  AND HAS THE FINEST NATURAL PARK IN THE WORLD  I   VE HEARD THAT THE SCENERY IN IT IS MAGNIFICENT    

   I WONDER IF IT WILL BE   CAN BE   ANY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THIS     MURMURED ANNE  LOOKING AROUND HER WITH THE LOVING  ENRAPTURED EYES OF THOSE TO WHOM    HOME    MUST ALWAYS BE THE LOVELIEST SPOT IN THE WORLD  NO MATTER WHAT FAIRER LANDS MAY LIE UNDER ALIEN STARS 

THEY WERE LEANING ON THE BRIDGE OF THE OLD POND  DRINKING DEEP OF THE ENCHANTMENT OF THE DUSK  JUST AT THE SPOT WHERE ANNE HAD CLIMBED FROM HER SINKING DORY ON THE DAY ELAINE FLOATED DOWN TO CAMELOT  THE FINE  EMPURPLING DYE OF SUNSET STILL STAINED THE WESTERN SKIES  BUT THE MOON WAS RISING AND THE WATER LAY LIKE A GREAT  SILVER DREAM IN HER LIGHT  REMEMBRANCE WOVE A SWEET AND SUBTLE SPELL OVER THE TWO YOUNG CREATURES 

   YOU ARE VERY QUIET  ANNE     SAID GILBERT AT LAST 

   I   M AFRAID TO SPEAK OR MOVE FOR FEAR ALL THIS WONDERFUL BEAUTY WILL VANISH JUST LIKE A BROKEN SILENCE     BREATHED ANNE 

GILBERT SUDDENLY LAID HIS HAND OVER THE SLENDER WHITE ONE LYING ON THE RAIL OF THE BRIDGE  HIS HAZEL EYES DEEPENED INTO DARKNESS  HIS STILL BOYISH LIPS OPENED TO SAY SOMETHING OF THE DREAM AND HOPE THAT THRILLED HIS SOUL  BUT ANNE SNATCHED HER HAND AWAY AND TURNED QUICKLY  THE SPELL OF THE DUSK WAS BROKEN FOR HER 

   I MUST GO HOME     SHE EXCLAIMED  WITH A RATHER OVERDONE CARELESSNESS     MARILLA HAD A HEADACHE THIS AFTERNOON  AND I   M SURE THE TWINS WILL BE IN SOME DREADFUL MISCHIEF BY THIS TIME  I REALLY SHOULDN   T HAVE STAYED AWAY SO LONG    

SHE CHATTERED CEASELESSLY AND INCONSEQUENTLY UNTIL THEY REACHED THE GREEN GABLES LANE  POOR GILBERT HARDLY HAD A CHANCE TO GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE  ANNE FELT RATHER RELIEVED WHEN THEY PARTED  THERE HAD BEEN A NEW  SECRET SELF CONSCIOUSNESS IN HER HEART WITH REGARD TO GILBERT  EVER SINCE THAT FLEETING MOMENT OF REVELATION IN THE GARDEN OF ECHO LODGE  SOMETHING ALIEN HAD INTRUDED INTO THE OLD  PERFECT  SCHOOL DAY COMRADESHIP   SOMETHING THAT THREATENED TO MAR IT 

   I NEVER FELT GLAD TO SEE GILBERT GO BEFORE     SHE THOUGHT  HALF RESENTFULLY  HALF SORROWFULLY  AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE     OUR FRIENDSHIP WILL BE SPOILED IF HE GOES ON WITH THIS NONSENSE  IT MUSTN   T BE SPOILED   I WON   T LET IT  OH  WHY CAN   T BOYS BE JUST SENSIBLE    

ANNE HAD AN UNEASY DOUBT THAT IT WAS NOT STRICTLY    SENSIBLE    THAT SHE SHOULD STILL FEEL ON HER HAND THE WARM PRESSURE OF GILBERT   S  AS DISTINCTLY AS SHE HAD FELT IT FOR THE SWIFT SECOND HIS HAD RESTED THERE  AND STILL LESS SENSIBLE THAT THE SENSATION WAS FAR FROM BEING AN UNPLEASANT ONE   VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH HAD ATTENDED A SIMILAR DEMONSTRATION ON CHARLIE SLOANE   S PART  WHEN SHE HAD BEEN SITTING OUT A DANCE WITH HIM AT A WHITE SANDS PARTY THREE NIGHTS BEFORE  ANNE SHIVERED OVER THE DISAGREEABLE RECOLLECTION  BUT ALL PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH INFATUATED SWAINS VANISHED FROM HER MIND WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOMELY  UNSENTIMENTAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE GREEN GABLES KITCHEN WHERE AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY WAS CRYING GRIEVOUSLY ON THE SOFA 

   WHAT IS THE MATTER  DAVY     ASKED ANNE  TAKING HIM UP IN HER ARMS     WHERE ARE MARILLA AND DORA    

   MARILLA   S PUTTING DORA TO BED     SOBBED DAVY     AND I   M CRYING    CAUSE DORA FELL DOWN THE OUTSIDE CELLAR STEPS  HEELS OVER HEAD  AND SCRAPED ALL THE SKIN OFF HER NOSE  AND      

   OH  WELL  DON   T CRY ABOUT IT  DEAR  OF COURSE  YOU ARE SORRY FOR HER  BUT CRYING WON   T HELP HER ANY  SHE   LL BE ALL RIGHT TOMORROW  CRYING NEVER HELPS ANY ONE  DAVY BOY  AND      

   I AIN   T CRYING    CAUSE DORA FELL DOWN CELLAR     SAID DAVY  CUTTING SHORT ANNE   S WELLMEANT PREACHMENT WITH INCREASING BITTERNESS     I   M CRYING  CAUSE I WASN   T THERE TO SEE HER FALL  I   M ALWAYS MISSING SOME FUN OR OTHER  SEEMS TO ME    

   OH  DAVY     ANNE CHOKED BACK AN UNHOLY SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER     WOULD YOU CALL IT FUN TO SEE POOR LITTLE DORA FALL DOWN THE STEPS AND GET HURT    

   SHE WASN   T MUCH HURT     SAID DAVY  DEFIANTLY        COURSE  IF SHE   D BEEN KILLED I   D HAVE BEEN REAL SORRY  ANNE  BUT THE KEITHS AIN   T SO EASY KILLED  THEY   RE LIKE THE BLEWETTS  I GUESS  HERB BLEWETT FELL OFF THE HAYLOFT LAST WEDNESDAY  AND ROLLED RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THE TURNIP CHUTE INTO THE BOX STALL  WHERE THEY HAD A FEARFUL WILD  CROSS HORSE  AND ROLLED RIGHT UNDER HIS HEELS  AND STILL HE GOT OUT ALIVE  WITH ONLY THREE BONES BROKE  MRS  LYNDE SAYS THERE ARE SOME FOLKS YOU CAN   T KILL WITH A MEAT AXE  IS MRS  LYNDE COMING HERE TOMORROW  ANNE    

   YES  DAVY  AND I HOPE YOU   LL BE ALWAYS VERY NICE AND GOOD TO HER    

   I   LL BE NICE AND GOOD  BUT WILL SHE EVER PUT ME TO BED AT NIGHTS  ANNE    

   PERHAPS  WHY    

      CAUSE     SAID DAVY VERY DECIDEDLY     IF SHE DOES I WON   T SAY MY PRAYERS BEFORE HER LIKE I DO BEFORE YOU  ANNE    

   WHY NOT    

      CAUSE I DON   T THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO TALK TO GOD BEFORE STRANGERS  ANNE  DORA CAN SAY HERS TO MRS  LYNDE IF SHE LIKES  BUT I WON   T  I   LL WAIT TILL SHE   S GONE AND THEN SAY    EM  WON   T THAT BE ALL RIGHT  ANNE    

   YES  IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WON   T FORGET TO SAY THEM  DAVY BOY    

   OH  I WON   T FORGET  YOU BET  I THINK SAYING MY PRAYERS IS GREAT FUN  BUT IT WON   T BE AS GOOD FUN SAYING THEM ALONE AS SAYING THEM TO YOU  I WISH YOU   D STAY HOME  ANNE  I DON   T SEE WHAT YOU WANT TO GO AWAY AND LEAVE US FOR    

   I DON   T EXACTLY WANT TO  DAVY  BUT I FEEL I OUGHT TO GO    

   IF YOU DON   T WANT TO GO YOU NEEDN   T  YOU   RE GROWN UP  WHEN I   M GROWN UP I   M NOT GOING TO DO ONE SINGLE THING I DON   T WANT TO DO  ANNE    

   ALL YOUR LIFE  DAVY  YOU   LL FIND YOURSELF DOING THINGS YOU DON   T WANT TO DO    

   I WON   T     SAID DAVY FLATLY     CATCH ME  I HAVE TO DO THINGS I DON   T WANT TO NOW    CAUSE YOU AND MARILLA   LL SEND ME TO BED IF I DON   T  BUT WHEN I GROW UP YOU CAN   T DO THAT  AND THERE   LL BE NOBODY TO TELL ME NOT TO DO THINGS  WON   T I HAVE THE TIME  SAY  ANNE  MILTY BOULTER SAYS HIS MOTHER SAYS YOU   RE GOING TO COLLEGE TO SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH A MAN  ARE YOU  ANNE  I WANT TO KNOW    

FOR A SECOND ANNE BURNED WITH RESENTMENT  THEN SHE LAUGHED  REMINDING HERSELF THAT MRS  BOULTER   S CRUDE VULGARITY OF THOUGHT AND SPEECH COULD NOT HARM HER 

   NO  DAVY  I   M NOT  I   M GOING TO STUDY AND GROW AND LEARN ABOUT MANY THINGS    

   WHAT THINGS    

           SHOES AND SHIPS AND SEALING WAX
     AND CABBAGES AND KINGS       
 
QUOTED ANNE 

   BUT IF YOU DID WANT TO CATCH A MAN HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT IT  I WANT TO KNOW     PERSISTED DAVY  FOR WHOM THE SUBJECT EVIDENTLY POSSESSED A CERTAIN FASCINATION 

   YOU   D BETTER ASK MRS  BOULTER     SAID ANNE THOUGHTLESSLY     I THINK IT   S LIKELY SHE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS THAN I DO    

   I WILL  THE NEXT TIME I SEE HER     SAID DAVY GRAVELY 

   DAVY  IF YOU DO     CRIED ANNE  REALIZING HER MISTAKE 

   BUT YOU JUST TOLD ME TO     PROTESTED DAVY AGGRIEVED 

   IT   S TIME YOU WENT TO BED     DECREED ANNE  BY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF THE SCRAPE 

AFTER DAVY HAD GONE TO BED ANNE WANDERED DOWN TO VICTORIA ISLAND AND SAT THERE ALONE  CURTAINED WITH FINE SPUN  MOONLIT GLOOM  WHILE THE WATER LAUGHED AROUND HER IN A DUET OF BROOK AND WIND  ANNE HAD ALWAYS LOVED THAT BROOK  MANY A DREAM HAD SHE SPUN OVER ITS SPARKLING WATER IN DAYS GONE BY  SHE FORGOT LOVELORN YOUTHS  AND THE CAYENNE SPEECHES OF MALICIOUS NEIGHBORS  AND ALL THE PROBLEMS OF HER GIRLISH EXISTENCE  IN IMAGINATION SHE SAILED OVER STORIED SEAS THAT WASH THE DISTANT SHINING SHORES OF    FAERY LANDS FORLORN     WHERE LOST ATLANTIS AND ELYSIUM LIE  WITH THE EVENING STAR FOR PILOT  TO THE LAND OF HEART   S DESIRE  AND SHE WAS RICHER IN THOSE DREAMS THAN IN REALITIES  FOR THINGS SEEN PASS AWAY  BUT THE THINGS THAT ARE UNSEEN ARE ETERNAL
